chrome extension to help curate your x feed with embeddings

## todo
- input arbitrary text
- handle images somehow. twitter is like 50% images these days. llm write me description?
  - break up settings for embeddings and llm models
- do something with the positives. maybe just always return if postive?

## thoughts
- explore vector math. is this -sarcasm still outside the threshold?
